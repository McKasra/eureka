# eureka
A repository for metadata CSV files exported from DLCS (UCLA Library's homegrown Digital Library Collection System). 

Naming convention: collection name (shortened).csv. E.g., bennett.csv

Directory scheme:
- prod - ingest on production
- stage - getting ready for productiom; ingest on stage and evaluate
- test - not ready; okay to manually ingest on test

at some point we might automate that...
