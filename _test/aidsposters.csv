Employment or pre-employment testing for HIV antibody is unnecessary and should not be required. Like all medical information, information on whether someone is infected with HIV should be confidential. There should be no obligation for an employee to inform the employer about his or her HIV/AIDS status. HIV infection is not a reason for dismissal. Workers who are HIV infected must be protected from any discrimination or stigmatization. Since HIV infection by itself does not limit fitness to work, no changes in working arrangements are necessary. But if an employee becomes impaired by illness related to HIV, reasonable alternative work arrangements should be made to help the worker stay on the job.","","Pink background; blue text.

I am 32 years old and I am an Ojibway from the Cape Croker Band in Wiarton, Ontario. I worked at the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network in Ottawa for two years and the experience changed my life. My wife and I went home to the reserve and fought to have an HIV/AIDS curriculum put into our school so that our children could be educated about the disease. When I lived on the reserve, people with HIV/AIDS weren’t a big priority for me. When a woman within our community found out she was infected, the biggest thing we all thought was who was with her, who slept with who, and am I OK? That same woman didn’t get much help on our reserve, and I didn’t really care one way or the other about her. I believed if you were infected it was tour own fault – for choosing a different lifestyle, for not being married. Working with people with HIV/AIDS has opened us up to be more compassionate and understanding and hopefully we can change how people on our reserve think about HIV and those who live with this disease.

Behind him is a scene of water and shore before mountains with black cloud in sky.|~|In bottom of poster a picture shows an smiling native Canadian woman with additional inscription:My name is Zipporah Ypma. I am an Inuk woman born in Main Labrador. I worked as a nursing assistant in Labrador for many years. I have two grown children born after a year-long stint in the Armed Forces. I spent a number of years in the Arctic communities of Clyde River and Yellowknife. When I came to Ottawa, I agreed to join the steering committee of the Canadian Inuit HIV/AIDS Network and add my voice to the growing number of Inuit working to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS among our people. I do my best to encourage people to reach out with open hearts to those in need and help them to understand that this is just a disease. It does not change the true spirit of people living with HIV or AIDS. Discrimination is rooted in fear. Combating fear requires all of us to make sure others have the facts and that we remind them of the Inuit values and traditions of caring and concern for our community members in need.

I am an Inuk born in Iqaluit. I am 15 years old, and I live in Ottawa with my two fathers. My mother died from AIDS when I was only four years old. Sometimes people, not just kids, said mean things about my mother or called me names. It made us sad, not angry. People’s fear of HIV and AIDS is what made my mother decide it would be safer for me to be adopted out of my family by my dads in the south. My mother loved me enough to made sure I would be safe when she died. I am really proud of the remarkable things she did to educate Inuit about HIN/AIDS even they didn’t want to listen. Now tell people when it comes to HIV/AIDS not to be silent. Talk from your heart and tell people how you feel. Help them understand that the fear they feel is because they do not have facts and that they need to get them, not just for themselves but for their friends and family too.

Left to themselves, they are the target of numerous acts of violence: economic exploitation of their labor, abuse ...

The inexperience, emotion, and a certain apprehension may be disconcerting during your first intercourse. There is no need to have dozens of experiments to test or to experience pleasure ; hugs, kisses, discovering the body of another, are all sources. The condom does not necessarily make things easy, but it's important to talk about it before and use it right the first time and every time thereafter. This is the most effective way to protect yourselves from the AIDS virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). It is also a means of contraception. But mostly, it's  a proof of love. To speak to someone about it, call Youth Health at 05.235.236. AIDS Info Service and 05.36.66.36. Protect yourself from AIDS.|~|Additional poster text: Cet été, ce sera peut-être la premiére fois.

Le préservatif ne facilite pas forcément les choses. Mais c'est important d'en parler avant, de l'utiliser dès la première fois et à chaque fois ensuite. C'est le moyen le plus efficace de se protéger du virus du sida (VIH) et des maladies sexuellement transmissibles (MST). C'est aussi un moyen de contraception. C'est surtout une preuve d'amour.
