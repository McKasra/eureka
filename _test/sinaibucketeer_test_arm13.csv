(written surface area: 18x13.5 cm.).  Text in modern šełagir (fols. 1-9) and notragir (fols. 19-128), written by different hands in one column of 26 lines (fols. 1-20v), then in 31 lines (fols. 21-28). Subtitles in red bolorgir or notragir, and large initials in red erkat'agir.  Although the blank pages at the end of the codex (some ruled for margins) suggest that the text was copied in a bound book, the scribe has written the letters of the Armenian alphabet in the lower margins of some pages (e.g., fols. 4v and 5), conveying the impression that they are the numbers of the quires; actually, however, they do not correspond to the gatherings.  The scribe has also numbered the pages of the codex with Arabic numerals.|~|Illustrations: The illustrations in this codex consist of one headpiece and 70 decorative initials.  The headpiece (fol.4) is unfinished; it was sketched out in pencil, and the frame is outlined in red ink.  The large initial of the opening line of text on this page is formed by a peacock.|~|Binding: Not a traditional Armenian binding.  Executed in the nineteenth century.  Brown/red spinkled leather over pasteboards.  No tooling except on spine, where eight gold-tooled horizontal decorative lines divide the spine into seven panels.  Red and white silk endbands, with bead on the edge.  Poor pastedown.  Blue sprinkled edges.  Sewn on four raised cords; no notches.  Watermark: ""1805"" and crown with pipe and a fleur-de-lis.|~|History: According to the colophon (fol. 128), the MS was written at Madras, India, in 1811.  The priest Grigor Tēr Hayrapetian, who wrote this colophon, states that the codex was copied partly by himself and partly by others, whom he does not name.","The MS is a copy of the ""Commentary on the Divine Liturgy"" by Nersēs Lambronac'i.  The text is divided into 82 chapters.  The principal divisions of the book are as follows:Fols. 1-2v: Index to the Commentary on the Prayers of the Divine Litgury by Nersēs Lambronac'i).
